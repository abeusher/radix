// Package patricia is an implementation of a PATRICIA Tree.
//
// It has the three basic operations (insertion, lookup and deletion) plus
// some additional methods, notably one that allows a dynamic lookup based on delimiters,
// which works similar to a named parameter functionality in HTTP routers.
